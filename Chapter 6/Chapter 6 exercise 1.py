Exercise 1: 
Write a while loop that starts at the last character in the string and works its way backwards to the first character in the string, printing each letter on a separate line, except backwards.
Another way to write a traversal is with a for loop:
for char in fruit:
    print(char)
Each time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned to the variable char. The loop continues until no characters are left.

word = input("enter a word: ")
word_select = -1  
for char in word:
  print(word[word_select])
  word_select= word_select-1
